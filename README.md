# LearningToFly README

## Motivation
Living next to an airport during my schooling years, I often wondered if other schools had similar proximity to airports. This curiosity sparked the idea of creating a project that could provide accessible information about airports worldwide.

## Project Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to offer a simplified and user-friendly method of learning about airports around the world. By consolidating airport data into an easily navigable system, users can effortlessly explore and understand the global distribution of airports.

## Problem Solving
This project addresses the cumbersome process of searching for airports and managing their entries. By streamlining these tasks into a single platform, users can quickly locate airports, add new entries, or remove outdated information, enhancing efficiency and productivity.

## Key Learnings
Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into modularizing projects and integrating Python with SQL. Learning how to effectively structure and organize code modules, as well as leveraging SQL databases for data management, were significant learning outcomes.

## Unique Features
What sets this project apart is its graphical user interface (GUI) that offers an intuitive and visually appealing user experience. In addition, the project incorporates a wide range of features designed to enhance usability and functionality, making it stand out among similar solutions.
These features include:
- Search for continents: Retrieve continents from the database based on continent code, name, or both, displaying exact matches.
- Add a new continent: Insert a new continent into the database, providing necessary data points except the primary key.
- Update existing continent: Modify existing continent details in the database, except for the primary key.
- Search for countries: Query the database for countries using country code, name, or both, displaying exact matches.
- Add a new country: Insert a new country into the database, specifying relevant data points excluding the primary key.
- Update existing country: Modify existing country details in the database, excluding the primary key.
- Search for regions: Find regions within the database using region code, local code, name, or a combination, displaying exact matches.
- Add a new region: Insert a new region into the database, providing necessary data points except the primary key.
- Update existing region: Modify existing region details in the database, except for the primary key.
